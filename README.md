# Splunk Exploring SPL 

<h2>Description</h2>
<b>Splunk is a leading SIEM solution that enables real-time collection, analysis, and correlation of network and machine logs. In this module, we will explore the fundamentals of Splunk, its core functionalities, and how it enhances visibility into network activities while accelerating threat detection.

Splunk‚Äôs powerful capabilities allow users to search and analyze machine data efficiently. It uses Search Processing Language (SPL) to perform advanced searches. SPL includes a wide range of functions and commands that can be combined to create complex yet effective queries for optimized results.</b>

<b>Q: What is the name of the host in the Data Summary tab?</b><br>
ADD index=windowslogs * is used to filter data from the ‚Äúwindowslogs‚Äù index, showing all events represented by the asterisk (). Time filter set to all, to get all the existing logs

<b>Answer: Cyber-host </b>

<b>Familiarize Yourself with the UI:</b>

Search & Reporting App is the default interface used to search and analyze the data on the Splunk Home page. It has various functionalities that assist analysts in improving the search experience.

Some important functionalities present in the search App are explained below:

<b> 1) Search Head: </b>
   
Search Head is where we use search processing language queries to look for the data.

<b> 2) Time Duration: </b>
   
This tab option provides multiple options to select the time duration for the search. All-time will display the events in real-time. Similarly, the last 60 minutes will display all the events captured in the last hour.

<b> 3) Search History: </b>
   
This tab saves the search queries that the user has run in the past along with the time when it was run. It lets the user click on the past searches and look at the result. The filter option is used to search for the particular query based on the term.

<b> 4) Data Summary: </b>
   
This tab provides a summary of the data type, the data source, and the hosts that generated the events as shown below. This tab is very important feature used to get a brief idea about the network visibility.

<b>Question: In the search History, what is the 7th search query in the list? (excluding your searches from today)</b>

Setting no time filter to get all possible logs with the time duration set to week to date.
ignore all the logs for today and the answer can be obtained at the 7th place from the first search that did not occur today.
